/// This widget shows up when you are on the matchmaking database and there is still no one else in it.
/// Also shows while the players are doing 'handshaking', that in this case is just exchanging the player names,
/// but could be a lot of info.
///
/// This could have been done in one less step (no need to second player to come here) just also putting first player
/// name on RTDB but this way is a nicer and more complete example for a real complex pr√©-match handshaking case
///
///  After this step both players have exchanged their name and id and have the matchID.

/// ToDO: Recheck this
